This is a python project.
A game about which you can find all information below:
ust a simple game in python...

Game play:
You have to dodge the falling balls and every ball you dodge adds up to your score.

Game Requirements:
well you'll be needing a text editor to copy paste the source code code in the file "dodge.py". I reckon sublime text editor along with REPL package.

Note:
The game source code is not very object oriented rather structured programmed.
--> Please do give feedback about what to improve, i'm just a beginner in coding so that'll help me a lot thankyou.
